##Script description
The run_analysis.R script reads the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and merges the test and training set.

In order to run, the script must be in the same folder as the data.

The script output is the tidyDataSet.txt file, described in the Codebook.md file.
